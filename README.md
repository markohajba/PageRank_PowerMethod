Institution: Virovitica University of Applied Sciences, Croatia
Authors: Marko Hajba, Luka Majcenić, Nikola Stjepanović

This repository contains code and data used to test PageRank algorithm using Power Method.

This code and data is part of article in progress written on Croatian language: PageRank algoritam.
ALgorithm will be tested on small graph (4 pages), random graph of user defined size and big, real data graph.
Also, there are some sources to check PageRank of particular domain, sources to download big data matrices from real world.
