Institution: Virovitica University of Applied Sciences, Croatia

Authors: Marko Hajba, Luka Majcenić, Nikola Stjepanović

This repository contains code and data used to test PageRank algorithm using Power Method.

This code and data is part of article written on Croatian language: http://e.math.hr/Vol39/Hajba_et_al.
Algorithm is tested on small graph (4 pages), random graph of user defined size and big, real data graph.
Also, there are some sources to check PageRank of particular domain, and also sources to download big data matrices from real world.
