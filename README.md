This repository contains code and data used to test PageRank algorithm using Power Method.
This code and data is part of article in progress written on Croatian language: PageRank algoritam.
There will be done tests on small graph (4 pages), random graph of user defined size and big, real data matrix.
Also, there are some sources to check PageRank of particular domain, source to download big data matrices from real world.
